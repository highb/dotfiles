# Documents Directory

The `Documents/` directory stores various document artifacts, organized into subdirectories following the [PARA](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) method for organization.

## Purpose
This directory serves as a central location for storing document-related files, allowing for easy retrieval and organization based on the PARA method. My personal method of syncing these directories is via SynologyDrive, choose your own preferred sync technology.

## About PARA
[PARA](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) stands for Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives, a framework for organizing digital information proposed by Tiago Forte. It provides a systematic approach to managing documents and other digital assets, enhancing productivity and clarity.

- **Projects**: Active tasks or initiatives with clear outcomes and deadlines.
- **Areas**: Areas of responsibility or interest that require ongoing attention and maintenance.
- **Resources**: Reference materials that provide valuable information or support for projects and areas.
- **Archives**: Completed projects, outdated information, or reference materials no longer actively used.

## Usage
Files related to projects, areas of responsibility, valuable resources, and archived documents can be organized within the appropriate subdirectories based on the PARA method.
