# dotfiles

Miscellaneous config files, etc that I manage using [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io).

## TODO

- add something similar to my [.bhell](https://github.com/highb/.bhell)
scripts here that will manage installing any necessary packages using some cobbled
together scripts that use _waves hands around_ a package manager (Nix, brew, etc.)
- determine a good way to sync the .config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml file, as well
- manage application color schemes in some sane way
- use some fancy templates and secrets manager stuff
