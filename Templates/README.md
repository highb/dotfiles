# templates/

The files in this directory will be added to the context menu of file managers such as Nautilus.
Apparently, this is part of the XDG spec although it's difficult for me to find somewhere that
documents their use and capabilities.

TODO Folder structures can be created from templates using
[nautilus-new-folder-from-template](https://gitlab.com/edgimar/nautilus-new-folder-from-template).
What if this was extended to provide a full templating language for files, as well?
