# Bin Directory

The `bin/` directory is dedicated to storing single binary tools and personal scripts. Scripts are synced by Chezmoi, while binaries are directly stored.

## Purpose
This directory serves as a convenient location for storing executable files, including custom scripts and standalone binaries.

## Management
Scripts stored in this directory are managed and synced by Chezmoi, ensuring consistency across Linux systems. However, binaries are stored directly and may require manual management.

## Usage
Custom scripts and single binary tools can be placed in this directory for easy access and execution. These files can perform various tasks and automate processes on your system.
